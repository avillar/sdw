# Time Entity Relations

The materials in this directory provide an extension to [OWL-Time](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-time/) to complete the set of relations required to express all the relationships between temporal entities using OWL axiomatization. 
This work currently has the status of an Interest Group Note. 

The formatted version of the Note may be viewed at https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-owl-time-rel/

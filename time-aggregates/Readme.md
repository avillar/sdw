# Time Aggregates

The materials in this directory provide an extension to [OWL-Time](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-time/) to support the description of arbitrary temporal aggregates. 
Note that this does **not** include recurring sequences or infinite series. 
This work currently has the status of an Interest Group Note. 

The formatted version of the Note may be viewed at https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-owl-time-agg/
